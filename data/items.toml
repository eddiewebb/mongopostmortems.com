description = "At a high level, the Mongo database that backs our account service experienced severe performance degradation, which in turn caused our account service to be unavailable from April 11th 20:44 UTC to April 12th 14:30 UTC.  This means all login requests, account creations, and queries for account information failed. "

description = "Foursquare recently suffered a total site outage for eleven hours. The outage was caused by unexpected uneven growth in their MongoDB database that their monitoring didn't detect. The system outage was prolonged when an attempt to add a partition didn't work due to fragmentation, and required taking the database offline to compact it. "

description = "Our database (MongoDB) died approximately 5:19am UTC. The primary was stuck in a connection loop (out of threads for new connections). We got the alert, but it seemed to have self-healed thru migrating to its secondary. The primary resynced and everything appeared to be fine. The alerts turned back green. What we didn't realize was that between 5:44am and 8:20am UTC, there was a series of small hiccups (queue buildups, flushes, repeat) that we hadn't noticed. Rollbar complained about Mongo connection errors sporadically."
